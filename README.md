# Multimodal-data-processing-system-with-audio
This Python script, designed for Google Colab, allows users to upload an audio file, converts it into text using the `SpeechRecognition` library, and displays the transcribed text. It handles audio processing by converting files to `.wav` format (if needed) and uses Google's speech recognition API for transcription.
